/* This type is a subclass of GtkWindow that ties the window to a
 * ShellGtkEmbed; the window is reparented into the stage
 * window for the actor and the resizing logic is bound to the clutter
 * logic.
 *
 * The typical usage we might expect is
 *
 *  - ShellEmbeddedWindow is created and filled with content
 *  - ShellEmbeddedWindow is shown with gtk_widget_show_all()
 *  - ShellGtkEmbed is created for the ShellEmbeddedWindow
 *  - actor is added to a stage
 *
 * Ideally, the way it would work is that the GtkWindow is mapped
 * if and only if both:
 *
 * - GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE (window) [widget has been shown]
 * - Actor is mapped [actor and all parents visible, actor in stage]
 *
 * Implementing this perfectly is not currently possible, due to problems
 * in Clutter, see:
 *
 * http://bugzilla.openedhand.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1138
 *
 * So until that is fixed we use the "realized" state of the ClutterActor
 * as a stand-in for the ideal mapped state, this will work as long
 * as the ClutterActor and all its parents are in fact visible.
