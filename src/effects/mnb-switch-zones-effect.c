 * this way even if something goes wrong with the effect, once the effect
 * finishes the desktop is not messed up and remains usable.
 *
 * The effect is constructed of there layers of actors:
 *
 * desktop: this is the top level container for the effect; a NbtkBin with the
 *          *#zone-switch-background style.
 *
 * frame:   this is a window onto the desktop; this actor has the zoom effects
 *          applied to (it needs to be separate from the desktop, so that as we
 *          zoom the desktop background remains full screen).
 *
 * strip:   this an NbtkTable with a single row that contains the individual
 *          desktop thumbnails. Its position within the frame determines what
 *          what user sees; the strip has the motion part of the effect applied
